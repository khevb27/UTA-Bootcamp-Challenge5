## Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
----------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description

This application is designed to assist with daily task management by scheduling events hourly through JavaScript. The workday planner is equipped with various features such as color-coding for different time blocks, displaying the current day at the top of the calendar, and a save button that stores data in local storage and retains it even after the page is refreshed. The color-coding system helps users quickly identify whether a time block is in the past, present, or future, making it simpler to manage time.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
